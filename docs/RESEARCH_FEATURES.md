# 🎯 Research Features: Market Impact & Liquidation Analysis

## Overview

Two new research-focused visualizations have been added to answer critical questions about Hyperliquid's market microstructure:

## 🎯 Feature 1: Wallet Orderbook Impact Analysis

### Research Question
**"Which wallets move each orderbook the most?"**

### What It Shows

This comprehensive dashboard analyzes wallet-level impact on specific orderbooks, revealing:

#### **Top Market Movers by Volume**
- Wallets ranked by total trading volume
- **Color coding** (critical insight):
  - **Red bars** = High taker ratio (aggressive, consumes orderbook) → **PRIMARY MARKET MOVERS**
  - **Green bars** = High maker ratio (provides liquidity)
- Shows which wallets have the most influence

#### **Average Price Impact per Trade**
- Scatter plot: Number of trades vs Average price impact
- **Bubble size** = Average trade size
- Identifies wallets with:
  - **High impact** = Each trade moves price significantly
  - **Large sizes** = Whales doing big trades
  - **Many trades** = Active high-frequency movers

#### **Aggressive Trading Volume**
- Shows orderbook consumption by wallet
- **Red bars** = Volume from market-taking trades
- Higher = more aggressive market participation
- **Key insight**: These wallets are actively moving the market

#### **Trade Size Distribution**
- Box plots for top 5 wallets
- Reveals trading patterns:
  - **Narrow boxes** = Algorithmic (consistent sizing)
  - **Wide boxes** = Discretionary (variable sizing)
  - **High medians** = Large average trades

### How to Use for Research

1. **Select a coin** (e.g., BTC, ETH)
2. **Adjust top N wallets** (5-30 depending on your needs)
3. **Look for patterns**:
   - Red bars with high volume = **Primary market movers**
   - High price impact + large bubbles = **Whales**
   - Many trades + high impact = **Active algo traders**

### Key Metrics Provided

- **Top N Wallets Control**: % of total volume
- **Market Taking**: % of trades that consume orderbook
- **Top Single Wallet**: Largest individual trader

### Research Insights

**Example findings you can discover:**
- "Top 15 wallets control 65% of BTC volume"
- "Wallet 0x1234... has 0.45% average price impact per trade"
- "85% of ETH volume comes from aggressive orderbook consumption"

## 💥 Feature 2: Liquidation Analysis

### Research Question
**"At what price points do liquidations occur on each orderbook?"**

### What It Shows

This heatmap visualizes liquidation events and their concentration at specific price levels:

#### **Liquidation Hotspot Heatmap**
- **Scatter plot**: Time vs Price
- **Bubble size**: Trade size (larger = bigger liquidation)
- **Color coding**:
  - **Red** = Losses (likely forced liquidations)
  - **Green** = Profits (voluntary closes)
- **Patterns reveal**:
  - Horizontal clusters = Liquidation-prone price levels
  - Vertical clusters = Liquidation cascades (multiple at once)
  - Red concentration = Forced liquidation zones

#### **Large Closes by Price Level**
- Histogram showing closure concentration
- **Peaks** = Most liquidation-prone prices
- Identifies key risk zones

#### **Position Close Volume Over Time**
- Cumulative volume of closed positions
- **Steep slopes** = Liquidation cascades
- **Flat sections** = Calm periods
- Shows when liquidations accelerate

#### **Close Direction Distribution**
- Bar chart of close types:
  - "Close Long"
  - "Close Short"
  - "Long > Short" (flips)
  - "Short > Long" (flips)
- Reveals liquidation bias (more longs or shorts getting liquidated)

### How to Use for Research

1. **Select a coin**
2. **Examine the heatmap**:
   - Find **horizontal red clusters** = Dangerous price levels
   - Look for **cascade patterns** = Multiple liquidations in sequence
3. **Check the histogram**:
   - **Peaks** = Where most liquidations happen
4. **Analyze cumulative volume**:
   - **Steep increases** = Liquidation events
5. **Review High-Risk Price Levels table**:
   - Top 5 price ranges with most liquidations

### Key Metrics Provided

- **Total Close Volume**: Size of all position closures
- **Number of Closes**: Count of liquidation events
- **Avg Close Size**: Typical liquidation size
- **Largest Price Cluster**: Most dangerous single price zone

### Research Insights

**Example findings you can discover:**
- "BTC has liquidation cluster at $115,200-$115,400 ($3.2M closed)"
- "85% of ETH liquidations were Long closes (bearish cascade)"
- "Liquidation cascade occurred at 17:23 UTC ($8.5M in 2 minutes)"
- "Price level $4,210-$4,215 accounts for 40% of all ETH closures"

## 🎓 Research Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Market Manipulation Detection
**Question**: Are specific wallets manipulating prices?

**How to investigate**:
1. Go to **Wallet Impact Analysis**
2. Identify wallets with:
   - High aggressive volume
   - High price impact
   - Concentrated trading times
3. Go to **Individual Trader Detail** tab
4. Check their P&L and timing patterns

**Red flags**:
- Large aggressive trades consistently moving price
- Suspicious profit patterns
- Coordinated timing

### Use Case 2: Liquidation Cascade Prediction
**Question**: Where are the next liquidations likely to occur?

**How to investigate**:
1. Go to **Liquidation Analysis**
2. Identify price levels with high closure concentration
3. Compare current price to liquidation zones
4. Check cumulative volume chart for cascade patterns

**Prediction signals**:
- Price approaching high-concentration zone
- Previous cascade patterns
- Directional bias (more longs or shorts at risk)

### Use Case 3: Whale Tracking
**Question**: Who are the market-moving whales and what are they doing?

**How to investigate**:
1. **Trader Analytics** → Identify whales (high volume, low maker ratio)
2. **Wallet Impact** → Confirm their orderbook impact
3. **Individual Trader Detail** → Track their activity
4. Monitor their:
   - Preferred coins
   - Trading times
   - Directional bias

**Whale indicators**:
- >$5M volume
- <30% maker ratio
- High price impact
- Large trade sizes

### Use Case 4: Market Microstructure Research
**Question**: How concentrated is orderbook control?

**How to measure**:
1. **Wallet Impact** → Check "Top N Wallets Control" metric
2. Run analysis for multiple coins
3. Compare concentration ratios

**Research findings**:
- Market concentration levels
- Decentralization metrics

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Data Quality
- **Liquidations** are identified by:
  - Position closing trades (dir contains "Close")
  - Large position size changes
  - Negative P&L (likely forced)
- Not all closes are liquidations (some are voluntary)

### Performance
- Both visualizations process the full dataset
- Initial load: ~10-20 seconds
- Subsequent loads: Instant (cached data)
- Handles 100K+ trades efficiently
